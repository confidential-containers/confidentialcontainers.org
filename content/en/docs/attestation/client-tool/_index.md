This is a simple client for the Key Broker Client (KBS) that facilitates testing of the KBS and other basic attestation flows.

You can run this tool inside of a TEE to make a request with real attestation evidence. You can also provide pre-existing evidence or use the sample attester as a fallback.

The client tool can also be used to provision the KBS/AS with resources and policies.
