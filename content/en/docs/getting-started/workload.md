## Creating a sample Confidential Containers workload

Once you've used the operator to install Confidential Containers, you can run a pod with CoCo by simply adding a runtime class.
First, we will use the `kata-qemu-coco-dev` runtime class which uses CoCo without hardware support.
Initially we will try this with an unencrypted container image.

In this example, we will be using the bitnami/nginx image as described in the following yaml:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: nginx
  annotations:
    io.containerd.cri.runtime-handler: kata-qemu-coco-dev
spec:
  containers:
  - image: bitnami/nginx:1.22.0
    name: nginx
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  runtimeClassName: kata-qemu-coco-dev
```

Setting the `runtimeClassName` is usually the only change needed to the pod yaml, but some platforms
support additional annotations for configuring the enclave. See the [guides](../guides) for
more details.

With Confidential Containers, the workload container images are never downloaded on the host.
For verifying that the container image doesnâ€™t exist on the host, you should log into the k8s node and ensure the following command returns an empty result:
```
root@cluster01-master-0:/home/ubuntu# crictl -r unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock image ls | grep bitnami/nginx
```
You will run this command again after the container has started.

Create a pod YAML file as previously described (we named it `nginx.yaml`) .

Create the workload:
```
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```
Output:
```
pod/nginx created
```

Ensure the pod was created successfully (in running state):
```
kubectl get pods
```
Output:
```
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          3m50s
```
