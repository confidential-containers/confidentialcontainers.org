Confidential Containers encapsulates pods inside of confidential virtual machines,
allowing Cloud Native workloads to leverage confidential computing hardware
with minimal modification.

Confidential Containers extends the guarantees of confidential computing to complex workloads.
With Confidential Containers, sensitive workloads can be run on untrusted hosts
and protected from compromised or malicious users, software, and administrators.

Confidential Containers provides an end-to-end framework for deploying workloads,
attesting them, and provisioning secrets.
